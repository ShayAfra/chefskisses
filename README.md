How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript, DaisyUI, and EJS

This web application is written using MVC as the framework. The front end was written using EJS and DaisyUI which is powered by Tailwind CSS. I really enjoyed using EJS as it was so similar to writing HTML. The decision to use DaisyUI seemed like an easy choice as can easily apply beautiful styling with a simple edition of classes to the EJS. As for the backed I used Express for the server framework and MongoDB for the database.

Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about bootstrap, Tailwind, and DaisyUI while writing this project. Initially it was written using bootstrap, but I wanted to add some more styling to it and decided to look into Tailwind and DaisyUI. I settled on DaisyUI because of how smooth and seamless it came off as.
